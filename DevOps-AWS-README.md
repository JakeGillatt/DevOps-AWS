# What is DevOps?

DevOps is a practice of philosophies that aims to bridge the gap
between software development and operations teams.

The main goal of a DevOps engineer is to achieve faster more reliable software delivery.

Devops focuses on automation, collaboration, continuous integration & delivery,
as well as monitering and feedback

# Why DevOps?

There are various reasons why DevOps interests me:

- Due to the dynamic and challenging work, it's interesting and rewarding to work on projects that require problem solving and innovation.
- There are always opportunities for growth and development. Because DevOps is always evolving there are always new technologies and practices to learn.
- Impact on software delivery. As we're responsible for helping to deliver software to the business and its customers, you can get a great sense of achievement and purpose for the work you have done.
- Job security and demand. DevOps engineers are high in demand and its a career that looks like it will be in demand for the foreseeable future.

# Benefits of DevOps

which allows new features and updates to be released more frequently.

- Practices such as automatic testing and continuous monitoring can help businesses find and fix issues before
they can impact customers.

- DevOps encourages collaboration and communication between teams which improves the overall efficiency of an organisation.

# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing allows users to access and use computing resources over the internet.
These resources can include servers, data storage, databases, applications, computer hardware and others.

# What are the benefits of the Cloud?

- Cost-effective for businesses
- Good security of data
- Ease of use and customisable

# How does the Cloud fit into DevOps

Cloud computing is an essential part of DevOps because it enables teams to deploy and manage their applications and infrastructure more effectively.
Cloud environments can be created so that applications can be built and tested on the same platforms and machines. This reduces issues when
passing applications or software between people and teams who use different computers.
