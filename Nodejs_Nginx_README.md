# What is Node.Js?

Node.js is a cross-platform, server side JavaScript environment. It allows developers to write server-side applications
in JavaScript. Node.js is widely used for building web applications, APIs, real-time chat applications, serverless 
functions, and many other types of applications.

# How does Node.Js work?

Node.js uses  the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine to compile JavaScript into machine code for faster execution.
When a Node.js application is started, it initializes an event loop that listens for incoming requests, processes them, 
and returns the response.
Node.js can handle a large number of concurrent connections without blocking the execution of other tasks.

# What are the dependencies of Node.Js?

Node.js has a number of core modules that are included with the installation of Node.js itself. These modules provide 
basic functionality such as file system access, networking, and HTTP server capabilities.

In addition to the core modules, Node.js has a large and growing ecosystem of third-party modules that can be installed 
using the Node Package Manager (NPM). These modules can provide a wide range of additional functionality, such as 
database connectivity, logging, testing, and more.

# What is the Node Package Manager (NPM)?

The NPM is used to manage and share reusable packages of code (modules) that can be easily installed into Node.js 
projects. NPM is also the default package manager for the Node.js runtime environment.

# What is Nginx?

Nginx is popular web server software that can serve various types of content including images, 
videos and web applications.
Nginx is also often used as a load balancer in front of application servers to distribute incoming traffic across 
multiple servers to ensure high availability and scalability. It can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer 
and HTTP cache. It supports multiple platforms and can be easily integrated with various web technologies such as PHP, 
Python, Ruby on Rails, and more.

# What is Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices (such as web browsers) and backend servers (such as web 
servers or application servers) and forwards client requests to the appropriate backend server. The response from 
the backend server is then sent back to the reverse proxy, which in turn sends it back to the client device.
A reverse proxy can be used for a variety of purposes, including load balancing, traffic routing, and caching.
It can also cache frequently requested content, such as images or videos, and serve it directly to the client devices 
without having to forward the request to the backend server.
